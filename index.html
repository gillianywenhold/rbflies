    <h1>LEARNING TO READ</h1>
    <p class="first"> <span class='intro'>IN TODAY'S WORLD </span>reading is one of the most fundamental capacities that an individual can develop. For some, reading can open up bold new worlds and unlock many untold mysteries. For others reading can end the dilemma of paradox and ambiguity. For everyone, learning to read is essential. This workbook had been designed so that anyone, regardless of age, can learn how to read.</p>
    <p> <span class='intro'>THE INSTRUCTIONAL </span>part of this workbook is to be used as an aid to the person who will explain its contents to the student. The person that is READING the information in this workbook is to be the facilitator. The person LEARNING to “read” and use the materials in this workbook is the learner. The exercises are designed to help the learner learn how to learn.</p>
    <h3>UNLOCKING THE DYNAMIC LAND OF LANGUAGE</h3>
    <p class="first"> <span class='intro'>UNDERSTANDING THE BASIC COMPOSITION </span>of letters is a major key to unlocking the dynamic land of language. The words: character, letter and symbol are synonymous (equal) when speaking of words as language.</p>
    <p> <span class='intro'>SOUND IS USED </span>as a means to communicate recognition of our conscious experiences (ORAL COMMUNICATION). What is known as letters are representative symbols of SOUND. How letters sound when said alone and when they come together to form words is the focus of this workbook.</p>
    <h3>FIRST THINGS FIRST</h3>
    <p class="first"> <span class='intro'>IN ORDER TO READ </span>in an effective manner it is important to realize the sounds that are associated with each letter. All letters (symbols) have sounds that they represent. Some even have multiple sounds. This exercise will help the learner to learn the different sounds that are produced when each letter
        (character) is joined with another.</p>
    <img id='imageleft' style="padding-top: .5%" src="images/globe.png">
    <p>The first thing the learner must do is learn the sound or sounds of each letter. By doing this, the learner will be learning the alphabet. Before the learner can read effectively,
            s/he must know the alphabet.</p>
